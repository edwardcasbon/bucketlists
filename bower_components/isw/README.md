# Ingeniously Simple Web (ISW)

## Introduction
Ingeniously Simple Web (ISW) is the Web team's approach at providing consistent code, design and components across Redgate's web based projects/products.

ISW is designed to be the core foundation for a web project to be built from. Website developers then build their web project using, and building upon, the building blocks and components that ISW provides.

## Bower
ISW is packaged as a Bower package, and therefore can be distributed across projects using the Bower package manager (http://bower.io/, a package manager for the web).

This allows the project to be separated, managed and distributed easily, and allows developers to easily update their projects to the latest, or specific version, of ISW.

### SSH keys
In order to use the ISW package with Bower, you need to have an SSH key set up between your computer/terminal and GitHub. (This is because the ISW package is hosted on the private Redgate GitHub account, and can't be accessed publically.)

Please visit https://github.com/settings/ssh to check your SSH keys, and https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/ for help on generating a new SSH key.

### Getting ISW into your project
Firstly, make sure you've installed Bower.

Once Bower is installed, add a bower.json manifest file into the root of your project and add the following json:

<pre><code>{
    "name": "Your project name goes here",
    "version": "Your project version goes here, e.g. 1.0.0",
    "dependencies": {
        "isw": "git@github.com:red-gate/ingeniously-simple-web.git"
    }
}
</code></pre>

Then, simply run <code>bower install</code>. If you've got your SSH key set up correctly, Bower will grab the latest version of ISW.

You should now see a new directory <code>bower_components</code> in your root directory. This will include the <code>isw</code> directory, where all the ISW code is kept.

Please refer to the ISW instructions (coming soon) to learn how to use ISW in your project.
